# Advent2020_MUMPS

Trying to impliment solutions to advent of code 2020 challenges in MUMPS/Objectscript. Sharing in case anyone interested.

Currently will only run in Intersystems IRIS/Cache (they provide a docker version if you're interested).

I have vague ideas about:
-rewriting in strict ANSI MUMPS 
-setting up CI/CD to run/test automatically (to make a more useful demo)
-using opensource GT.M as the runtime rather than Intersystems IRIS

It remains to be seen if I will spend any time on this beyond solving the puzzles each day.
